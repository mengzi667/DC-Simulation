    \label{fig:ch5_throughput_pallets}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Analysis:} Figure~\ref{fig:ch5_throughput_pallets} reveals that total inbound pallet throughput remains stable (113k--120k pallets), while outbound throughput decreases with shorter opening hours (from 131k in Baseline to 106k in Scenario 3). This 19\% reduction in outbound volume indicates that shorter windows constrain system capacity to clear outbound demand, despite inbound arrivals being largely accommodated.

    \caption{FG outbound throughput by destination region (pallets). G2 region accounts for approximately 80\% of FG volume, consistent with configured regional distribution.}
    \label{fig:ch5_throughput_region}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Analysis:} The regional split remains stable across scenarios (79.7--80.3\% G2, ~20\% ROW), confirming that the arrival generation mechanism correctly implements the 80/20 G2/ROW distribution. Both regions experience proportional throughput reductions as opening hours decrease.

\subsubsection{Order Count versus Pallet Volume}
\label{subsubsec:ch5_orders_pallets}

To support operational planning, Figure~\ref{fig:ch5_orders_pallets} presents a dual-metric view of throughput, comparing pallet volumes with order counts.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../outputs/figures/4c_flow_statistics_orders.png}
    \caption{Comparison of pallet volume (left bars) versus order count (right bars) across categories. Data annotations show both metrics for each category and direction.}
    \label{fig:ch5_orders_pallets}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Analysis:} The pallet-to-order ratios remain consistent across scenarios: FG outbound averages ~100 pallets/order, while R\&P outbound averages ~190 pallets/order. This consistency validates the pallet-load distribution sampling mechanism and confirms that operational dynamics are not distorted by stochastic variations in truck sizing.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{../outputs/figures/4d_fg_outbound_orders_by_region.png}
    \caption{FG outbound order counts by destination region. G2 region handles 483--578 orders per 30-day period, while ROW handles 119--144 orders.}
    \label{fig:ch5_outbound_orders_region}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Analysis:} Order count reductions follow pallet volume trends: Scenario 3 processes 17\% fewer FG orders than Baseline (604 vs 721 orders). The G2/ROW order split (~80/20) mirrors the pallet distribution, confirming uniform pallet-load distributions across regions.
